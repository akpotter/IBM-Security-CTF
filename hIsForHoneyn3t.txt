data structures (especially stacks) should be aligned on natural boundaries when-
ever possible. The reason for this is that the processor requires two memory
accesses to make an unaligned memory access; aligned accesses require only one
memory access. A word or doubleword operand that crosses a 4-byte boundary or a
quadword operand that crosses an 8-byte boundary is considered unaligned and
requires two separate memory bus cycles for access.
Some instructions that operate on double quadwords require memory operands to be
aligned on a natural boundary. These instructions generate a general-protection
exception (#GP) if an unaligned operand is specified. A natural boundary for a double
quadword is any address evenly divisible by 16. Other instructions that operate on
double quadwords permit unaligned access (without generating a general-protection exception).
 However, additional memory bus cycles are required to access unaligned
data from memory.Words, doublewords, and quadwords do not need to be aligned in memory on natural
boundaries. The natural boundaries for words, double words, and quadwords are
even-numbered addresses, addresses evenly divisible by four, and addresses evenly
divisible by eight, respectively. However, to improve the performance of programs,
